#Join
Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
